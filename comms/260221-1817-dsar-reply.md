Subject: Re: GDPR Data Subject Access Request

---

Dear Mr. Hultén,

Thank you for your message and for formally submitting your request under GDPR
Article 15.

We take data protection and user privacy seriously. After reviewing your
request, we can confirm the following:

Memvid does not collect, transmit, store, or process personal data from users
of the memvid-cli or memvid-core software. The .mv2 file format is fully local
and user-controlled. All data written to an .mv2 file is created, stored, and
managed exclusively by the user on their own machine or storage medium.

Specifically:

- We do not collect telemetry, metrics, usage analytics, device identifiers,
  or tracking fingerprints from memvid-cli.
- We do not maintain any database of user activity related to CLI usage.
- We do not process personal data via the CLI.
- We do not share CLI data with any third parties because no such data is
  collected.
- There is no data retention period applicable, as no personal data is stored
  or processed by us in this context.

Memvid-cli operates as a local-first tool. Any network calls performed by the
CLI are limited to explicitly invoked commands such as model or ticket
verification against a configured API endpoint. These calls do not include
personal data beyond what the user explicitly provides during that request.

Because we do not hold or process personal data concerning you, there is no
personal data to provide in response to your access request under Article 15.

If you believe a specific network request or endpoint call constitutes personal
data processing, please provide the exact command used, timestamp, and relevant
logs so we can investigate further.

We appreciate your diligence and remain available for clarification.

Best regards,

The Memvid Team
