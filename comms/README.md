# Communications

This directory contains markdown transcripts of emails (and other
correspondence, as applicable) I've had related to this investigation. Each
email will be represented as a single markdown file, with relevant email header
information at the top of the file. Each file is individually timestamped using
OTS (see [top level README](../README.md)).

Threading and additional context is provided in this document, allowing the
individual message files to fully and solely represent a message.

## Note on redactions

Personal contact information (private email addresses, direct phone numbers,
etc.) will be redacted from these files in order to protect individual privacy
while maintaining corporate accountability. Complete, unredacted copies are
retained separately for legal and regulatory purposes.
