Subject: Re: GDPR Data Subject Access Request

Hi Jonas,

We appreciate you providing additional context regarding the network requests
observed in verbose mode and would like to clarify their purpose and scope.

In our previous response, we stated:

“Memvid-cli operates as a local-first tool. Any network calls performed by the
CLI are limited to explicitly invoked commands such as model or ticket
verification against a configured API endpoint. These calls do not include
personal data beyond what the user explicitly provides during that request.”

To expand on this clarification, Memvid provides both a free tier and paid
tiers. Free users are limited to a maximum .mv2 file size of 50MB. Paid users
can increase their file capacity beyond this limit and are allocated monthly
query allowances under their subscription plan.

For paid plans, the CLI performs network requests to verify that a valid
license or capacity ticket is active, confirm the permitted file size limit,
and record aggregate query usage counts per billing period. This includes
counting how many times operations such as file reads, find, or ask are
invoked. This tracking exists solely for subscription enforcement and capacity
management. It allows us to ensure that paid users remain within their
allocated file size and monthly query limits.

No .mv2 file contents are transmitted. No frame data, transcripts, embeddings,
or stored memory data are transmitted. No personal documents or local file
contents are uploaded. We do not collect device fingerprints or behavioral
tracking identifiers.

The data transmitted for paid plans is limited to license identifiers and
aggregate operation counters necessary to enforce subscription limits.

We are happy to explain the functional purpose of these requests and the
categories of data involved. However, we are not able to disclose proprietary
implementation details or closed-source intellectual property related to the
internal architecture of our licensing and enforcement mechanisms. GDPR
provides a right of access to personal data, not a right to source code or
confidential technical designs.

If you are using a paid plan and would like a copy of the usage records
associated with your license identifier, please provide the license ID or the
email address used for purchase so that we can locate any associated records
and provide them in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format.

If you are not using a paid plan and no license is configured, then no usage
records are maintained on our systems.

Best regards,

The Memvid Team
