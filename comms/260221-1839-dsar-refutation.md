Dear Memvid Team,

Thank you for your expedient reply, but I respectfully disagree with your
assertion that "Memvid does not collect, transmit, store, or process personal
data".

In running the `memvid` CLI tool with verbose flags (`-vvvv`), the logs clearly
show the CLI making network requests to memvid.com. This call occurs on every
invocation of the CLI tool, including ostensibly local-only operations like
requesting the stats on an .mv2 file or attempting to open a file, including a
non-existent file. I have documented proof in the form of CLI logs displaying
this behavior, contradicting your statement that "Any network calls performed
by the CLI are limited to explicitly invoked commands".

I therefore re-assert my original Article 15 request. The compliance deadline
remains as stated in my previous email.

If you maintain that no data is being collected, despite the aforementioned
network calls, please explain their purpose and provide technical documentation
as to what is being transmitted.

Thank you.

Best regards,
Jonas A. Hultén
