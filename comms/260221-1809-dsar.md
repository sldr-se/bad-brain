Subject: GDPR Data Subject Access Request

---

Dear Memvid,

I am writing to request access to any and all personal data you hold and
process concerning me, as permitted under GDPR Article 15.

As I mentioned the last time I was in contact (2026-02-12), I have noticed that
your CLI tool `memvid-cli` is phoning home on invocation. Thus, I have reason
to believe you have information regarding me, which I now formally request.

My request includes, but is not limited to:

- Any and all telemetry, metrics, or usage data collected from any of your
  software(s)
- Any and all device identifiers, fingerprints, or other tracking identifiers
- The purposes for this processing, per GDPR Article 13(1)
- The justification for this processing, per GDPR Article 7(1) or 6(1), as
  applicable
- The timeframe which the data will be kept, per GDPR Article 13(2)
- Whether any third parties have gained access to data concerning me and, if
  so, which third parties, for what purposes, and what data

Please provide this information in a structured, commonly used, and
machine-readable format, as required by GDPR Article 15(3).

If you require additional information to locate or verify my data or otherwise
process this request, please specify exactly what you need. However, note that
under GDPR Article 12(3), **you have one month from the receipt of this
request** to comply, regardless of any additional information or clarification
you may request.

I look forward to your response.

Best regards,

Jonas A. Hultén
