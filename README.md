# bad-brain

This repository documents issues with the `memvid/claude-brain` plugin and the
`memvid` project in general, including potential GDPR violations, Apache 2.0
license non-compliance, and deceptive marketing practices.

## What This Is

A public evidence repository for:

- Undisclosed telemetry in software marketed as "100% local"
- Failure to provide source code despite Apache 2.0 licensing
- Potential GDPR violations (data processing without consent/disclosure)
- Suspicious GitHub metrics patterns

This list is neither exhaustive nor complete. It will be updated as the
investigation proceeds.

## Repository Structure

- **[analysis/](./analysis/)** - Technical analysis, GDPR assessment, code
  examination
- **[screenshots/](./screenshots/)** - npm download stats, GitHub star graphs,
  evidence captures, as and where applicable
- **[comms/](./comms/)** - Email correspondence, formal requests, responses

## Start Here

Read **[analysis/summary.md](./analysis/summary.md)** for a high-level overview
of the issues.

## Timestamping

Key files are timestamped using [OpenTimestamps](https://opentimestamps.org/)
to establish verifiable proof of existence. Files with `.ots` extensions are
timestamp proofs that can be independently verified.

## Status

This is an active investigation. Evidence is being collected, timestamped, and
documented as it becomes available. Structure may evolve/change as further
discoveries are made.
